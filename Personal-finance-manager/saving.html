            <h2>2. Setting Clear Savings Goals</h2>
            <p>Defining clear, specific savings goals is crucial for developing an effective saving strategy. Consider the following when setting your goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Short-term goals:</span> Objectives you want to achieve within the next 1-3 years (e.g., building an emergency fund, saving for a vacation)</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Medium-term goals:</span> Objectives for the next 3-10 years (e.g., saving for a down payment on a house, starting a business)</li>
